# Algorithm Visualizer

A dynamic and interactive tool for visualizing sorting algorithms. This project includes three modes:
- **Single Algorithm Mode**: Visualize the step-by-step process of a single sorting algorithm.
- **Comparison Mode**: Compare the performance of two algorithms side-by-side.
- **Practice Mode**: Learn and practice sorting interactively with guidance and feedback.

## Features
- **Visualization**: Watch sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort in action.
- **Comparison**: Compare two algorithms side-by-side to analyze performance differences.
- **Practice**: Interactive mode to learn and test your understanding of sorting algorithms.
- **Customization**: Adjust array size and visualization speed dynamically.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes for better usability.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/apinchofpepper/AlgorithmVisualizer.git
cd AlgorithmVisualizer
```

### Open in Browser
Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite browser.

## Usage

### Single Algorithm Mode
- Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
- Adjust the array size and speed using the sliders.
- Click "Generate Array" to create a random array.
- Click "Start Visualization" to watch the algorithm in action.

### Comparison Mode
- Select two algorithms to compare.
- Adjust the array size and speed for both algorithms.
- Click "Generate Arrays" to create random arrays for comparison.
- Click "Start Comparison" to see how both algorithms perform side-by-side.

### Practice Mode
- Switch to practice mode by clicking the "Practice Mode" button.
- Follow the on-screen instructions for the selected algorithm.
- Use interactive features to practice sorting while receiving hints and feedback.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Markup for structuring the application.
- **CSS3**: Styling the UI, including animations and dark mode.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Core functionality for sorting, visualization, and interactivity.
